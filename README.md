# Create a Portfolio Project

Little explanation needed. This is merely a place to store my _Create a Portfolio_ Project for the **Udacity Front-End Web Development Course**. I am also taking this as an opportunity to practice github markdown code. 

Live version is available at: http://aduff.org/Udacity

Source code available here.

* _index.html_ - All html code.
* _css/main.css_ - Main CSS file.
* _js/main.js_ - Main Javascript file - uses jQuery
* _img directory_ - Houses all of the images I am using.
